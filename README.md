# Intrvl
highly configurable interval timer with multiple sport support. Track your calorie burn and heart rate accurately for the intended sport using this slick workout app.

Intrvl lets you track your workouts and save them to health kit for any interval sport available. The settings screen allows you to customise

* Pause time
* Resting time
* Interval time
* Warm up time
* Stretch time
* Preparation time
* Interval count

Some of these can be set to 0 (like warm up time) if you do not want to do one. Intrvl is smart enough to only count time that you are working (warmup & interval time) to your actual workout. Your activities can be save to health hit and in your activity rings you will see the sport selected.

Intrvl has a clean interface with the user in mind, numbers can be seen from a distance while training and so on. Smart haptics and notification levels come as standard as some sports are more strenuous than others.

The watch app comes with the ability to lock the screen and unlock using the digital crown for sports where you may accidently press an undesired button.
